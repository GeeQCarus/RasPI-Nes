you will also need to have

a Multimeter or circuit tester ( if you solder to the 72 pins adapter to install on cartridge)
a solder gun with lead ( for the run pin, the 72 pin adapter and the arduino)
a dremel with precision heads
thick glue, like Lepage Gel the one shown in my video works perfectly or a hot glue gun!
