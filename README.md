How to build a Raspberry Pi Nes

Please follow the youtube tutorial in order to know what to connect and where, I do not hold any responsabilities on any damaged PI or Arduino, following my guide will grant you a bunch of AWE from your friends :)

Long live retrogaming, kodi, PI and.... whatever your imagination bring you from this guide!

You will need the following tools 

1) Arduino IDE
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2) SD card formatter
https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/

3) Win 32 Disk Imager
https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

4) 7zip because it's free, no adds and powerful!
http://www.7-zip.org/

suggestion: if you want to tweak and adjust the code, also, copying from this site to your PI via putty is not recommended, copy here to notepad++ to SSH
install Notepad ++
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.2.html

Add arduino language addon to Notepad ++
