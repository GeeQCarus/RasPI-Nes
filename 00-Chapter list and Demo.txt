Hello, welcome to my guide on how to create a Raspberry NES with RetroPIE, Kodi and more!

In this first video we will demo the possibilities, many fast-forward will be seen but ill put a timer to show you the real time it took!

Then I will show you the structure of the tutorial by chapter, each chapter will be in a separate youtube video for many reasons

1) A 60 minute video, is not appealing
2) Each user has different knowledge, so skip the parts you know!
3) I will be able to post a Chapter at a time and take all the effort in each smaller video to give you the best experience!
