1-micro sd per cartridge, 32 gigs max as higher capacity are in exFAT, even though you can force a fat 32 format it is not recommended
dont buy the cheapest one... its your hard drive, it will impact performance!

you will also need to have

a Multimeter or circuit tester ( if you solder to the 72 pins adapter ton install cartridge)
a solder gun with lead ( for the run pin, the 72 pin adapter and the arduino)
a dremel with precision heads
thick glue, like Lepage Gel the one shown in my video works perfectly or a hot glue gun!
